             <div class="card-text">
For Muslims and non-Muslims alike, the main reason to come to Konya is to visit the Mevlâna Museum, the former lodge 
of the whirling dervishes and home to the tomb of Celaleddin Rumi (later known as Mevlâna),
 who we have to thank for giving the world the whirling dervishes. This is one of the biggest pilgrimage centres in Turkey, 
 and the building's fluted dome of turquoise tiles is one of Turkey's most distinctive sights.The symbol of Konya is this tekke 
 (Sufi lodge) complex that holds the tomb of the 13th-century religious leader, philosopher, and poet Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi,
 who founded the whirling dervish sect of Sufism. The museum is set within lovingly-tended rose gardens, which you walk through to the
 ornate Dervişan Kapısı (Gate of the Dervishes).                 <a style="margin-top: 10px; " href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/konya/attractions/mevlana-museum/a/poi-sig/474452/360882" class="btn btn-dark">for more</a>

		         <img src="images/arkeoloji.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">

         <div class="card-text">
Most of Turkey's archaeology museums have been jazzed-up and modernized 
in the past decade but not Konya's museum. This is a dusty old place with poor 
lighting and information panels that may as well be obsolete. But don't let that put you off, because
 the collection is excellent (and if you happen to like these relic museums with their treasure-hunt
 atmosphere, go now before it gets its much-needed facelift). There is a comprehensive display of finds 
 from the nearby archaeological site of Çatalhöyük and a wonderful collection of intricately decorated Roman sarcophagi.

Just down the road is Konya's Ethnography Museum, which holds a thorough collection of Turkish crafts, costumes,
 jewelry, carpets, and household goods but is sadly a bit dusty and unloved looking.        </div>

Konya's Selimiye Camii (mosque), right next to the Mevlâna Museum, is an example

 Ottoman prince and governor of the province of Konya. It was finished after he became sultan. Come to the square in the early evening 
 to get photos of the mosque and Mevlana Museum

 and restaurants, which are a great place to sit down and admire the view of minarets and domes while relaxing with a coffee or tea.    </div>

İnce Minare is the remains of a 13th century madrasah (school) built by the Anatolian Seljuks. 
Located close to the city center near the northern end of "Alaaddin Tepesi", this minaret and the surrounding small buildings

 mostly to the noteworthy ornamental architecture which has been very well preserved over the centuries. Alaaddin Hill (Alaaddin Tepesi). 
 This is an artificial hill that was built by the Seljuk Sultan Alaaddin Keykubat. Today it stands right in the middle of the city, and serves
 mostly as a park. Even though the small hill or the park on it may not be very interesting in themselves, the two places to stop by and see are
 1) the Alaaddin Mosque, and 2)the remmants of an old palace with partly earthen construction located on the north end of the hill - this old structure 
 is protected from the elements with a concrete umbrella. Meram. This is the district of Konya which lies somewhat away from the city center, with lighter
 construction and more greenery. The name "Meram" also refers to the popular picnic area located in the farther corner
 of the Meram district. Near this picnic area there are a few historic buildings to see, some of which are the "Tavus Baba Türbesi" and the "Ateşbazı
 Türbesi".     </div>

The Fasıllar monument is a large statue of the Hittite Storm-god, depicted in a mountainous temple, standing above a mountain
 god between two lions. It is located on the slope of a hill, west of the Fasıllar village of Beyşehir, Konya. The statue is 2.75 meters 
 in width and 8 meters in height. It weights about 70 tons and made of bazalt stone. Its current location is close to its quary, and this
 suggests that the statue never made it to its final destination. Certain parts of the monument is carved in more detail and some other 
 parts are in rough shape. Most Hittite monuments are relief type carvings on solid natural rock walls, whereas the Fasıllar monument is 
 carved on a separate rock block. 
Similarities to the Eflatunpınar figures and the Alacahöyük orthostats point to the time of Tudhaliya IV in the second half of the 13th century BCE.       </div>
